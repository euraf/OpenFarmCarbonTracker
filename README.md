# Open Farm Carbon Tracker

<h2>Overview</h2>

The Open Farm Carbon Tracker is an open source tool for diagnostics of farm scale greenhouse gas emissions. The tool is currently in development. 

<h2>Contributing</h2>

The Open Farm Carbon Tracker is a community project and we welcome contributions from anyone! 

<h3>Non-code contributions</h3>
There are several ways that you can contribute to the OFCT without coding. These are: 

<ul>
<li>Report bugs and issues <a href="https://github.com/euraf/OpenFarmCarbonTracker/issues">here</a></li>
<li>Translating the OFCT app to local language.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contributing with sources and references for parameters</h3>

<strong>Contributing sources for parameters</strong>

The Open Farm Carbon Tracker seeks to adhere to the highest standards of transparency and scientific rigor. This means that sources needs to:
<ul>
  <li>be supported by litterature, ideally peer reviewed litterature</li>
  <li>have a DOI, to ensure permanence in the source availability</li>
</ul>

<strong>Parsing country LPIS data for data automation pipelines</strong>

With the OFCT it's possible to leverage national LPIS data to quickly populate input data for establishing a baseline scenario for a farm. Each country has their own LPIS data format that is update one or several times a year. LPIS data integeration is currently being developed for the following countries:

<ul>
  <li>Denmark (DK)</li>
  <li>Finland (FI)</li>
</ul>

The following countries have high priority: 

<ul>
  <li>Spain (ES)</li>
  <li>France (FR)</li>
  <li>Netherlands (NL)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contributing to development</h3>

<strong>Methodologies and model development</strong>

The long term strategy of the Open Farm Carbon Tracker is to improve modelling from Tier 1 towards Tier 2 and 3. We welcome any contributions that can:
<ul>
  <li>evaluate, scrutinize and improve already implemented methodologies</li>
  <li>increase methodologies from Tier 1 to Tier 2 and 3</li>
</ul>

<strong>Usability and performance</strong>

The OFCT consist of both a model and a UI aspect for running the model. 

<h2>Deplying and integrating the OFCT</h2>

<strong>Run your own instance of the OFCT model and app</strong>

<strong>Call external OFCT instance from your app</strong>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

The Open Farm Carbon Tracker is being developed as part of the DIGITAF project, which was funded by the EU.
